Plan :
    1. write test cases for the problem statements.
    2. get the list of transactions as part of input data.
    3. sort the list based on duplicate records except time.
    4. create group of lists on the basis of duplicate record for easy calculation.
    5. convert the list to dataframe of pandas to reduce complexity to O(n).
    6. sort the list via time in ascending order.
    7. write business logic.
    8. validate test cases wrote in step 1.
    9. check code comments and indentation.

Checklist :
    1. E2E code working.
    2. Test cases passed.
    3. Boundary test cases added.
    4. code indentation.
    5. code cleanup : remove commented block of code.
    6. re-read code comment block.
